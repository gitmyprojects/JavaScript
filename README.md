# JavaScript

This repository is comprised of various projects both big and small. The small projects were pushed so that the instructors could monitor progress. The bigger projects  are examples of applying the various elements, structures, and techniques learned through the course. 

The [Calculator](https://github.com/gitmyprojects/JavaScript/tree/main/Calculator) directory files were an exercise in which I created a working calculator.

The [Pizza_Project](https://github.com/gitmyprojects/JavaScript/blob/main/Pizza_Project/Pizza.html) directory files were an exercise in which I created a menu for an online ordering of a pizza. 

The [TicTacToe](https://github.com/gitmyprojects/JavaScript/tree/main/TicTacToe) directory is an exercise in using JavaScript to create a TicTacToe game that can be played against the computer.  

The rest of the project files are comprised of various elements that utilize JavaScript to utilize a wide variety of commonly used aspects of the language.
